# Users from Stephen Grider's "The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB"

## Description

This is a walk through of the first project on Stephen Grider's Udemy course entitled, "The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB". It included some of the basics like installing Mongoose setting up the Robo3T app and building Schemas and Models. Utilized Mocha testing suites to test queries, operators, basic validation, subdocuments and associations. Populated the User blogPosts. Added middleware and a middleware test to clean up all user blog posts when the user is deleted. Learned about and used Promise.all() which seems pretty handy in my opinion. We learned about Pagination and implemented sort(), skip(), and limit().
